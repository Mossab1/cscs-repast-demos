=What is this tutorial for?=

==How to use this tutorial?==

This How-To/What-Is guide basically will help you learn how to model using RepastS with Relogo Platform. This guide does not assume any pre-requisites apart from the mentioned ones, although it is advisable to go through each question in the order in which they are given. Please don't skip questions if you are a new user. Each question builds
on to the other. Although, this guide tells you how to make a model from scratch, but you can also try other documents (_a list can be found in What other such documents are available?_). 

Some part of the code is not dealt with in this tutorial. That code is mostly feature extension and does not affect the overall behavior of the system. 
   
Hope you'll find this guide fun and easy to learn. Cheers !!! 

==Where is this model and who wrote this?==

The complete commented source code of the model can be found [https://cscs-repast-demos.googlecode.com/svn/mudit/followTheLeade here]. This tutorial and model was written by [Mudit Mudit Raj Gupta] under the guidance of [http://mypages.iit.edu/~tataeri/ Dr. Eric Tatara]. The code is wellThe model is fully commented and each class and function has a description attached. The part of the code which is not explained in the tutorial is either self - explanatory or is irrelevant to the system behavior. Let us see what other documents and models are available.   

==What other such documents are available?==

You can check out the Relogo Getting Started guide [http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs/ReLogoGettingStarted.pdf here]. It is an excellent piece of text for starting with relogo. You can also check other Relogo models and their Model Description and documentation 
[http://code.google.com/p/cscs-repast-demos/wiki/RepastSReLogo here]. But let us first understand a bit about multi-agent modeling.

=What to know and do before getting started?=

==What is Multi-Agent Modelling?==

Agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) is a relatively new approach to modelling complex systems composed of
interacting, autonomous agents. Agents have behaviours, often described by simple rules, and interactions with other
agents, which in turn influence their behaviours. By modelling agents individually, the full effects of the diversity that
exists among agents in their attributes and behaviours can be observed as it gives rise to the behavior of the system as a
whole. [1]

We are infact doing the same for this model. We are modeling artificial ants. These ants have relatively simple behaviour,
described by simple rules (which will be talked about in the nest question). This behavior is influenced by other ants and 
environment in which the ant is. When all ants are left to interact with each other  in a given environment, a complex overall 
behavior is noticed. Let us first figure out What are we modelling?
  
==What are We Modelling?==

The model is a simple multi agent model which demonstrates how the ant lines become short as time passes.
The model basically has an ant "nest"  and the "food"(refer to Fig. 1) . The ants are moving from 
the nest to the food source.

_Fig. 1_

Ants are guided by a set of simple rules, which are as follows :

An Ant can be either a "Leader"(first Ant coming out of the nest) or a "Follower" (rest all Ants) (refer to Fig. 2)

*Leader Ant*
	# It moves towards the food scent 
	# It turns at random angles (less than specified) and moves forward 
 	#  It stops if it finds food. 
*Follower Ants*
	# They start moving after a specified time delay (refer to Fig. 
	# They follow the ant infront of them by facing it and moving forward. 
        #  It stops if it finds food.

_Fig. 2_

Initially, ants take a longer route from nest to food. (refer to Fig. 3, denoted by red line). The following ants take smaller routes (refer to Fig. 4, denoted by blue lines) and finally the last ant takes 
the smallest route (refer to Fig 5, denoted by green line).

Keep on reading to find the prerequisites in the next section to make this model. You also check out the analysis in _What are the observations?_ (Although I would suggest making the model first and then reading the question, again go sequentially.) 

==What are the Prerequisites?== 

Before we can do anything with ReLogo, we need to make sure that we have a proper installation of Repast Simphony (version 2.0 Beta, released on 12/3/2010 or later). Instructions on downloading and installing Repast Simphony on various platforms can be found [http://repast.sourceforge.net/download.html here]. After installing go to the default/recommended setting for relogo. After installing the software open it.

If you are opening RepastS for the first time, it asks for a default workspace. The workspace is a directory used to store the models which you create, along with several settings. Do the following: 
 # Select a desired workspace, using the Browse. 
 # Check on _Use this as default and do not ask again_   
 # Click on OK

and switch to <Relogo> prospective using the following step:

- Open RepastS
- Go to the extreme top right corner and select relogo prospective (refer to Fig. 7)
- If it  is not available, click  on the double arrow to get a drop down menu (refer to Fig. 8)
- Select Relogo prospective by clicking it (refer to Fig. 8)

Now let us have a look at various elements on your screen now (Windows 7 screenshots). The figure mentions the name of various blocks and
the explaination is either self - explanatory or will be dealt later in the guide. (refer to Fig. 9)
