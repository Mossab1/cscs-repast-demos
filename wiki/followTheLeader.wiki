=What is this tutorial for?=

==How to use this tutorial?==

This How-To/What-Is guide basically will help you learn how to model using RepastS with Relogo Platform. This guide does not assume any pre-requisites apart from the mentioned ones, although it is advisable to go through each question in the order in which they are given. Please don't skip questions if you are a new user. Each question builds
on to the other. Although, this guide tells you how to make a model from scratch, but you can also try other documents (_a list can be found in What other such documents are available?_). 

Some part of the code is not dealt with in this tutorial. That code is mostly feature extension and does not affect the overall behavior of the system. 
   
Hope you'll find this guide fun and easy to learn. Cheers !!! 

==Where is this model and who wrote this?==

The complete commented source code of the model can be found [https://cscs-repast-demos.googlecode.com/svn/mudit/followTheLeade here]. This tutorial and model was written by [Mudit Mudit Raj Gupta] under the guidance of [http://mypages.iit.edu/~tataeri/ Dr. Eric Tatara]. The code is wellThe model is fully commented and each class and function has a description attached. The part of the code which is not explained in the tutorial is either self - explanatory or is irrelevant to the system behavior. 
Let us first understand a bit about multi-agent modeling.


=What to know and do before getting started?=

==What is Multi-Agent Modelling?==

Agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) is a relatively new approach to modelling complex systems composed of
interacting, autonomous agents. Agents have behaviours, often described by simple rules, and interactions with other
agents, which in turn influence their behaviours. By modelling agents individually, the full effects of the diversity that
exists among agents in their attributes and behaviours can be observed as it gives rise to the behavior of the system as a
whole. [1]

We are infact doing the same for this model. We are modeling artificial ants. These ants have relatively simple behaviour,
described by simple rules (which will be talked about in the nest question). This behavior is influenced by other ants and 
environment in which the ant is. When all ants are left to interact with each other  in a given environment, a complex overall 
behavior is noticed. Let us first figure out What are we modelling?
  
==What are We Modelling?==

The model is a simple multi agent model which demonstrates how the ant lines become short as time passes.
The model basically has an ant "nest"  and the "food"(refer to Fig. 1) . The ants are moving from 
the nest to the food source. 

https://cscs-repast-demos.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images_Mudit/Fig.%201.JPG

_Fig. 1_

Ants are guided by a set of simple rules, which are as follows :

An Ant can be either a "Leader"(first Ant coming out of the nest) or a "Follower" (rest all Ants) (refer to Fig. 2)

*Leader Ant*
	# It moves towards the food scent 
	# It turns at random angles and moves forward and stops on finding food. 

*Follower Ants*
	# They start moving after a specified time delay (refer to Fig. 
	# They follow the ant infront of them by facing it and moving forward and stops on finding food.

_Fig. 2_

Initially, ants take a longer route from nest to food. (refer to Fig. 3, denoted by red line). The following ants take smaller routes (refer to Fig. 4, denoted by blue lines) and finally the last ant takes 
the smallest route (refer to Fig 5, denoted by green line).

Keep on reading to find the prerequisites in the next section to make this model. You also check out the analysis in _What are the observations?_ (Although I would suggest making the model first and then reading the question, again go sequentially.) 

==What are the Prerequisites?== 

Before we can do anything with ReLogo, we need to make sure that we have a proper installation of Repast Simphony (version 2.0 Beta, released on 12/3/2010 or later). Instructions on downloading and installing Repast Simphony on various platforms can be found [http://repast.sourceforge.net/download.html here]. After installing go to the default/recommended setting for relogo. After installing the software open it.

If you are opening RepastS for the first time, it asks for a default workspace (refer to Fig. 6). The workspace is a directory used to store the models which you create, along with several settings. Do the following: 
 # Select a desired workspace, using the Browse. 
 # Check on _Use this as default and do not ask again_   
 # Click on OK

https://cscs-repast-demos.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images_Mudit/Fig.%206.JPG

_Fig. 6_

and switch to Relogo prospective using the following step:

 # Go to the extreme top right corner and select relogo prospective (refer to Fig. 7)
 # If it  is not available, click  on the double arrow to get a drop down menu (refer to Fig. 8)
 # Select Relogo prospective by clicking it (refer to Fig. 8)

Now let us have a look at various elements on your screen (Windows 7 screenshots). The figure mentions various blocks which are either self - explanatory or will be dealt later in the guide(refer to Fig. 9). Since it is an introductory guide, some parts are left unmarked, to be explored by the user

http://cscs-repast-demos.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images_Mudit/Fig.%209.jpg

_Fig. 9_

The Elements are as follows:

 # New, Save, Save All, Print (Left to Right)
 # Bug, Run (Left to Right)
 # New Relogo Project, Turtle, Link Patch Observer (Left to Right)
 # Prospective
 # Project Explorer
 # Working Space
 # Console  

Note : The elements can be customized according to user requirements.
Let us look at various steps in making this model.

=How to make the model?=

==How to make the a new project?==

The first thing you need to do while making a model is make a new project. This can be done by various means : 

 # _File >> New >> Relogo Project_ (refer to Fig. 10)
 # _New Project Button >> Relogo Project_ (refer to Fig. 11)
 # Click on the _New Relogo Project_ icon (refer to Fig.11) 

http://cscs-repast-demos.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images_Mudit/Fig.%2010.JPG

_Fig. 10_

http://cscs-repast-demos.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images_Mudit/Fig.%2011.JPG

_Fig. 11_

After any of the mentioned options a New Project _wizard_ appears on the screen. Do the following (refer to Fig. 12):

 # Enter the name of the project "followTheLeader" in the Project Name Field.
 # Click on _Next_

http://cscs-repast-demos.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images_Mudit/Fig.%2012.jpg

_Fig. 12_

After clicking the _Next_ button the wizard should look like Fig. 13. Click on the _Finish_ button  

http://cscs-repast-demos.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images_Mudit/Fig.%2013.JPG

_Fig. 13_


After _Finish_ the wizard will create a tree structure of the new project, and once it is done you can view your project in the project explorer. Click on the small arrow to view the sub directories. In the source folder you will find default classes. The structure should look like Fig. 14

http://cscs-repast-demos.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images_Mudit/Fig.%2014.JPG

_Fig. 14_

Right click on "UserTurtle.groovy" and select _delete_. We would not be using this class. Some models might require this class and others _(It is left to the user to explore)_. 

Let us see what is a turtle and how can we add one in our project.

==How to add Turtle behavior?==

"Turtles" or "Agents" are the basic building blocks of a multi-agent model. We also need "Ant" type turtles. We will first define the behavior of these ants using simple rules which were explained above and in further sections we will see how to create them and change their behaviors.

Let us first see how to add a turtle class to your project. 
Select _project explorer >> followTheLEader >> src >> followtheleader.relogo then you can follow any of the two methods:

 # _Right Click on followtheleader.relogo >> New >> Turtle_ (refer to Fig. 15)
 # Click on the _New Turtle_ button. (refer to Fig. 15)
 
http://cscs-repast-demos.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images_Mudit/Fig.%2015.jpg

_Fig. 15_

After the above command a new turtle dialog box appears on the screen. 
Follow the given steps (refer to Fig. 16):

 # Click on the _Name_ field and enter name. "Ant" for our project.
 # Click on _Generate Comments_ to automatically generate comments. (It might be useful)
 # Click on _Finish_

http://cscs-repast-demos.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images_Mudit/Fig.%2016.jpg

_Fig. 16_

After doing this, check your project's Directory structure, it will have a new class in the _followTheLeader >> src >> followtheleader.relogo_ with the name "Ant.groovy" (refer to Fig. 17) 

http://cscs-repast-demos.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images_Mudit/Fig.%2017.jpg

_Fig. 17_

Double click on Ant.groovy and you will be able to see the file. It should look like Fig. 18
