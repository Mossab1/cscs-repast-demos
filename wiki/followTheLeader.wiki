=What is this for?=

This How-To/What-Is guide basically will help you learn how to model using RepastS[1] with Relogo[2] Platform. 
This guide does not assume any pre-requisites apart from the mentioned [3] ones, although it is advisable to go through
each question in the order in which they are given. Please don't skip questions if you are a new user. Each question builds
on to the other. Although, this guide tells you how to make a model from scratch, but you can also try other documents[4] 
Hope you'll find this guide fun and easy to learn. Cheers

=What is Multi-Agent Modelling?=

Agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) is a relatively new approach to modelling complex systems composed of
interacting, autonomous agents. Agents have behaviours, often described by simple rules, and interactions with other
agents, which in turn influence their behaviours. By modelling agents individually, the full effects of the diversity that
exists among agents in their attributes and behaviours can be observed as it gives rise to the behaviour of the system as a
whole. [Ref1]

We are infact doing the same for this model. We are modeling artificial ants. These ants have relatively simple behaviour,
described by simple rules (which will be talked about in the nest question). This behavior is influenced by other ants and 
environment in which the ant is. When all ants are left to interact with each other  in a given environment, a complex overall 
behavior is noticed. Let us first figure out What are we modelling?
  
=What are We Modelling?=

The model is a simple multi agent model which demonstrates how the ant lines become short as time passes.
The model basically has an ant "nest"  and the "food"(refer to Fig. 1) . The ants are moving from 
the nest to the food source. Ants are guided by a set of simple rules, which are as follows :

 * An Ant can be either a "Leader"(first Ant coming out of the nest) or a "Follower" (rest all Ants)
 * Leader Ant
	* It moves towards the food scent (refer to Fig. 2)
	*  It turns at random angles (less than specified) and moves forward (refer to Fig. 2)
 	*  It stops if it finds food. (refer to Fig. 2)
* Follower Ants
	* They start moving after a specified time delay (refer to Fig. 

	* They follow the ant infront of them by facing it and moving forward. (refer to Fig. 3) 
	 
Initially, ants take a longer route from nest to food. (refer to Fig. 4, denoted by red). The following ants take smaller routes (refer to Fig. 5, denoted by blue) and finally the last ant takes 
the smallest route (refer to Fig 6, denoted by green). Keep on reading to find the prerequisites in the next section to make this model. You also check out the analysis in What are the observations? (Although I would suggest making the model first and then reading the question, again go sequentially.) 

=What are the Prerequisites?= 

Before we can do anything with ReLogo, we need to make sure that we have a proper installation of Repast Simphony (version 2.0 Beta, released on 12/3/2010 or later). Instructions on downloading and installing Repast Simphony on various platforms can be found here[1]. After installing go to the default/recommended setting for relogo. After installing the software open it 
and switch to <Relogo> prospective using the following step:

- Open RepastS
- Go to the extreme top right corner and select relogo prospective (refer to Fig. 7)
- If it  is not available, click  on the double arrow to get a drop down menu (refer to Fig. 8)
- Select Relogo prospective by clicking it (refer to Fig. 8)

Now let us have a look at various elements on your screen now (Windows 7 screenshots). The figure mentions the name of various blocks and
the explaination is either self - explanatory or will be dealt later in the guide. (refer to Fig. 9)
