== Introduction ==

My name is Richard Oliver Legendi, I'm in my second year at Eötvös Loránd University as a PhD student, at the Dept. of Programming Languages and Compilers. I've participated in the development of some other ABM tools (like [http://mass.aitia.ai/ MASS], [http://mass.aitia.ai/fables/ Fables], and [http://gridabm.sourceforge.net/ GridABM]).

It is a great pleasure to be on board and to be able to participate in the project.

I would like to create simple models and tutorials about how to link Repast with other commonly used tools (like [http://www.r-project.org/ R], [http://www.mathworks.com Matlab], [http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ Octave] and [http://www.maplesoft.com/products/maple/ Maple]), I believe this may help modelers and make [http://repast.sourceforge.net/ Repast S] a more widely used tool.

= Planned Models =
You can find the descriptions of the models I plan to create during the summer.

== Implementation of the !StupidModel ==

I am sure the [http://condor.depaul.edu/slytinen/abm/StupidModelFormulation.pdf StupidModel] (1) considered a relevant learning /comparison tool for agent-based modelling. In the last half-a-year I saw it appearing several places, like in the tutorial of gama-platform (2), and in a JASSS publication (3) with a Python API. I've also used it for comparing platforms in one of my publications with different software metrics.

There was a [http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ NetLogo] implementation from the beginning, and as I see it is accessible for [http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/ Mason] (4). It seems I'm a bit drop behind with [http://metaabm.org/ MetaABM], however, I made a bit of search and saw it is also accessible for this platform (5).

I believe it would worth implementing this tool, and improve the comparability with other platforms.
 
== Using External Tools with Repast S ==

I would like to create simple models and tutorials about how to link Repast with other commonly used tools (like R for statistics, Matlab for learning, Octave for some differential equations, and so on).

I believe such demo models and detailed descriptions may help modelers and make [http://repast.sourceforge.net/ Repast S] a more widely used tool.
