=*Introduction*=

 
I am a 6th semester student on Birla Institute of Technology and Science – Pilani studying at Goa Campus, I am simultaneously working for my Master’s degree in Chemistry and Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. 

I am interested in swarm robotics and embedded systems. A related field that interests me is Claytronics. It is about self-assembly of many modular robots to create synthetic reality. My recent work is centered on a new Wireless Sensor Network Platform and Mobile WSN. 

I will be making “Demo” models on the software as a part of my GSoC 2011 project. I am looking forward to learn the basics of design and simulation of complex systems and agent based complex systems as they are an integral part of mobile WSN and Swarm Robotics.

==*Ants*==

*Description*

Each Ant is guided by a set of simple rules. They keep on wandering in the environment in search of food or a chemical released by a food carrying Ant. If they bump into food they start taking it back to their colony (In the process releasing a chemical). If other ant come across the same chemical it follows the same. Thus the food is transfered to the ant colony.

*Application*

Such a behavior is observed in many social frameworks. It is very useful in task completion in swarm of robots. The same principle is used in data routing.

==*Preferential Linking*==

*Description*

At each step, a new node is added. A new node picks an existing node to connect to randomly, but with some bias. More specifically, a node's chance of being selected is directly proportional to the number of connections it already has, or its "degree." This is the mechanism which is called "preferential attachment."

*Application*

In some networks, a few "hubs" have lots of connections, while everybody else only has a few. This model shows one way such networks can arise.

Such networks can be found in a surprisingly large range of real world situations, ranging from the connections between websites to the collaborations between actors.

This model generates these networks by a process of "preferential attachment", in which new network members prefer to make a connection to the more popular existing members
