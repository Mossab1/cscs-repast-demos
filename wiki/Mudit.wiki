=*Introduction*=

 
Hi, I am Mudit, I am a 7th semester student on Birla Institute of Technology and Science – Pilani studying at Goa Campus, I am simultaneously working for my Master’s degree in Chemistry and Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. 

I am interested in swarm robotics, embedded systems and mobile Wireless Sensor Networks. I will be making “Demo” models on Repast S as a part of my GSoC 2011 project. I am looking forward to learn the basics of design and simulation of Agent Based Complex Systems as they are an integral part of mobile WSN and Swarm Robotics.
