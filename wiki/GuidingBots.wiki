=1. Description=

Guiding Motes are more sophisticated agents in the environment and are supposed to guide other daughter mote. They can transfer data to a daughter mote. A daughter mote can hatch into a guiding mote and can further guide other daughter motes, although these motes will have an error due to lack of sophisticated instruments. So, they will again convert back to daughter motes. If such motes guide other daughter motes, the error is also propogated  All daughter motes have to reach at the center of the world, where they die. They do not have good positioning instruments, so they rely on guiding motes.

Such a scenario is likely to happen in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks. Only few nodes will be equipped with GPS positioning systems, other nodes rely on them or motor feedback sysems, which are normally in accurate.

=2. User Control=

The user can control the population of both daughter motes and guiding motes.Further, user can control the step size and error tolerance also. Standard Setup, Go and Go Once Options are also present. User Panel looks like this :

=3. Output=

Model Outputter is also added. The added model outputter is comma separated values of "Time" and "Alive daughter Motes". One of the sample output file can be checked [https://code.google.com/p/cscs-repast-demos/source/browse/wiki/GuidingBots/Model%20Output.txt here]

*Note:* 

 # This Output can be fed into various external plug-ins available with RepastS like MATLAB and spreadsheet.

---------

=4. Analysis=

Various analysis could be carried out with the model, but for demonstration purpose a graph between, "Alive Daughter Motes" on y-axis and "Time" on x-axis is plotted.

For the plot it can be concluded that the death rate of the daughter motes follows an exponential function. _Check with many test runs_
