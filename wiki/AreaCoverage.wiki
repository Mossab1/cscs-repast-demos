= Introduction =


The model describes the area coverage pattern of a group of Agent, initially kept in a given geometry. The model is useful in studying the spread, the agent density at different radii and comparing the spread given different geometries. The model can be further extended and modified according to specific application. 


=Description= 


The guiding algorithm is fairly simple. Each agents, lets call it a "Mote", tries to more in the area where there are less number of motes initially available. This forces the overall colony of mots to expant and thus covering a given area. 

The initial position of motes lie inside a regular figure/geometry. The dimensions of which can be entered by the user. The initial geomwtries which come with the model are - 

1. Circle

2. Square

3. Hexagon

4. Line

All the Mote positions are random values generated within the boundary of the selected geometries. The code had embedded comments to aptly explain the formation of these initial geometries and random position generation. The following page in the Description Section details about the initial geometry formation.

The model also comes with a check box for automatically filling the motes in the selected geometry. 

In this mode maximum number of motes that can be accommodated in a given geometry are kept. This mode is useful overlap between agents is not favored. 

The number of steps the motes take at a given clock tick can also be changed by the user. The user can also select how many motes he/she wants in a simulation.


==Generating Initial Geometry=


Different Initial Geometries are generated by generating a random number for X coordinate, setting the limits depending on the initial side length or radius. Y coordinate is randomly generated and the limit is set by calculating the valid range of Y coordinates (at the generated X-coordinate) using trigonometry. 

In most cases regular figures are made. The one-quarter of the figure is made in the II quadrant and reflected along both the axes (x-axis and y axis)


==User Panel==


*Push Buttons (that rebounds) for setting up the motes and for making them move for one clock tick. 

*Toggle Button to run simulation in a loop till the button is toggled again.

*User can choose the initial geometry form Circle, Hexagon and Square.

*User can select "Number of Motes", "Step Size" and "Initial Side  Length/Radius"  

*User can check "Automatically Fill Initial Geometry" to automatically fill the selected geometry with maximum number of number of motes.

=Applications=

It can be used in swarm robotics application for studying optimum number of agents for a given area coverage in a given time frame. It can also be used for calculating robot density at a given time in a given radius. It will also be useful for social simulation. Each "Mote" or agent will decide its' movement on a local basis so no global communication between the robots is required and they can move and cover the area based on their neighbors.
 
=Extending the Model=

==Adding Initial Geometry==

The model can be extended to give mote density of different area(shapes) and even the user can add an irregular geometry 
or some other geometry according to project specific requirements.

==More Robot Specific==

The properties such as Battery Level and Power Loss in transmission can be added to the properties to make a rough estimate of the power source and energy dissipation.
