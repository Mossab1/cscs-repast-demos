= Introduction =

Each mote is tries to move in an area where there are less number 
of motes. This results in expansions. The initial positioning of the 
motes can be selected by choosing any of the three regular shapes - 
Circle, Square and Hexagon.

Model can be used to study the density of motes at different region,
the effect of initial geometry on the spread and rate at which the 
expansion is taking place.
