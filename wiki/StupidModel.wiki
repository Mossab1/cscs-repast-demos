#summary StupidModel Demo project.

= Introduction =
This tutorial is based on the article _[http://condor.depaul.edu/slytinen/abm/StupidModelFormulation.pdf StupidModel and Extensions: A template and teaching tool for agent-based modeling platforms]_ by Steven F. Railsback, Steven L. Lytinen and Stephen K. Jackson.

I am sure the !StupidModel considered a relevant learning /comparison tool for agent-based modelling. Several reference implementations may be found on [http://condor.depaul.edu/slytinen/abm/ Steven L. Lytinen's site]
