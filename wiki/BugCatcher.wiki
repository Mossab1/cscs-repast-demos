=1. Description=

Each Bug moves moves randomly in a given area. If a bug encounters a Bug Catching Machine in it's Moore neighborhood it gets caught in the machine. The bug dies after a specified time in the bug catching machine.

=2. User Control=

The user can control the population of the bugs and the machines.User can also control the time lapse between getting caught and death of a bug and bug speed. Standard Setup, Go and Go Once Options are also present. User Panel looks like this :

=3. Output=

Model Outputter is also added. The added model outputter is comma separated values of "Time" and "Bugs Alive". One of the sample output file can be checked [https://code.google.com/p/cscs-repast-demos/source/browse/wiki/BugCatcher/Model%20Output.txt here]

*Note:* 

 # This Output can be fed into various external plug-ins available with RepastS like MATLAB and spreadsheet.

---------

=4. Analysis=

Various analysis could be carried out with the model, but for demonstration purpose a graph between, "Bugs Alive" on y-axis and "Time" on x-axis is plotted.

For the plot it can be concluded that the bug death is an exponential function. _Check with many test runs_
