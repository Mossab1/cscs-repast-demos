= 1. Before Getting Started=


Before trying to use the model, make sure that Repast Simphony is installed properly (version 2.0 Beta, released on 12/3/2010 or later) is available to use.

Instructions on downloading and installing Repast Simphony on various platforms can be found on the [http://repast.sourceforge.net/download.html Repast download website].

RepastS models can be created with [http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs/RepastFlowGettingStarted.pdf Flowcharts], a Logo-like language called [http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs/ReLogoGettingStarted.pdf ReLogo], or purely in [http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs/RepastJavaGettingStarted.pdf Java and/or Groovy], and even C++ with [http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs/RepastHPCManual.pdf Repast HPC].

ReLogo was used to create the model. The documentations and other demo models on the same platform can be found [http://code.google.com/p/cscs-repast-demos/wiki/RepastSReLogo here].

It is suggested that you go through the following models also, as the guiding algorithm is quite similar, although the implementation is entirely different.

=2. Introduction =

This is a bio-inspired model. The model is a simulation of Ant and their behavior. The model demonstrates how ants move away from their nests in search for food and then come back to the nest with food. In their way back they leave a chemical behind which can be sensed by other ants and they can also reach the food pile. In their way reinforcing the chemical left behind. This behavior is useful to researchers from different field. Specially in Swarm Robotics and Computation Intelligence. The Ant Colony Optimization is used. A more clearer study of the Ant behavior can be done through [followTheLeader] model. In that model a single ant is studied and how the follower adjusts it's path. 

The following video aptly describes the ant behavior of the real world ants. 


The first paper which used ant behavior was published in the year 1996 was :

"Ant System: Optimization by a Colony of Cooperating Agents", Marco Dorigo, Vittorio Maniezzo and Alberto Colorni, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS-PART B CYBERNETICS, VOL 26, NO 1, FEBRUARY 1996, 1083-4419, IEEE 1996

There where many papers like this since then. An article which provides a comprehensive detail of the algorithm is :

"Ant Colony Optimization - Artificial Ants as a Computation Intelligence Technique" - Marco Dorigo, Mauro Birattari and Thomas Stutzle, IEEE COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE MAGAZINE, NOV 2006, 1556-603X/06/, IEEE 2006 


The model seeks inspiration form the real world ants. Although it is not a replica and is optimized at places. Please view the description section for complete details.
