= 1. Before Getting Started=


Before trying to use the model, make sure that Repast Simphony is installed properly (version 2.0 Beta, released on 12/3/2010 or later) is available to use.

Instructions on downloading and installing Repast Simphony on various platforms can be found on the [http://repast.sourceforge.net/download.html Repast download website].

RepastS models can be created with [http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs/RepastFlowGettingStarted.pdf Flowcharts], a Logo-like language called [http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs/ReLogoGettingStarted.pdf ReLogo], or purely in [http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs/RepastJavaGettingStarted.pdf Java and/or Groovy], and even C++ with [http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs/RepastHPCManual.pdf Repast HPC].

ReLogo was used to create the model. The documentations and other demo models on the same platform can be found [http://code.google.com/p/cscs-repast-demos/wiki/RepastSReLogo here].

It is suggested that you go through the following models also, as the guiding algorithm is quite similar, although the implementation is entirely different.

=2. Introduction =

This is a bio-inspired model. The model is a simulation of Ant and their behavior. The model demonstrates how ants move away from their nests in search for food and then come back to the nest with food. In their way back they leave a chemical behind which can be sensed by other ants and they can also reach the food pile. In their way reinforcing the chemical left behind. This behavior is useful to researchers from different field. Specially in Swarm Robotics and Computation Intelligence. The Ant Colony Optimization is used. A more clearer study of the Ant behavior can be done through [followTheLeader] model. In that model a single ant is studied and how the follower adjusts it's path. 

The following video aptly describes the ant behavior of the real world ants. 


The first paper which used ant behavior was published in the year 1996 was :

 - *"Ant System: Optimization by a Colony of Cooperating Agents"*, Marco Dorigo, Vittorio Maniezzo and Alberto Colorni, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS-PART B CYBERNETICS, VOL 26, NO 1, FEBRUARY 1996, 1083-4419, IEEE 1996

There where many papers like this since then. An article which provides a comprehensive detail of the algorithm is :

 - *"Ant Colony Optimization - Artificial Ants as a Computation Intelligence Technique"* - Marco Dorigo, Mauro Birattari and Thomas Stutzle, IEEE COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE MAGAZINE, NOV 2006, 1556-603X/06/, IEEE 2006 


The model seeks inspiration form the real world ants. Although it is not a replica and is optimized at places. Please view the description section for complete details. 

==Ant (A bit of Biology)==

Ants are social insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the mid-Cretaceous period between 110 and 130 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants.[7] More than 12,500 out of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified.[8][9].

Ants communicate with each other using pheromones. [10] Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. 

Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from further away. Several ant species even use "propaganda pheromones" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves.[11]  

==Ant and it's search for food==

Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that can be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes.[12]
