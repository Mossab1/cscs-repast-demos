Doing: finish uploading all files for Boids; start pages for a couple more models

Done: some [Boids] models

=== Ideas ===
Here's a list of my ideas so far - will put in short descriptions later.
 * [Boids]: Agents follow simple rules which adjust their heading based on their neighbors' relative position and heading, and organic flocks emerge.
 * Two body or three body: 
 * simple traffic 
 * simple weather 
 * ant foraging
 * penguin huddle
 * simple morphogenesis
 * cellular automaton 

===boids===
This is an old algorithm for agent-based modelling (it was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids published in 1986]), but it was definitely an influential one. Check out the video at the bottom of the page if you want to see what complex behavior a simple algorithm like boids can cause.

I'm an undergrad entering my final year at St. Mary's College of Maryland, a (secular) public liberal arts college. I'm doing my undergrad thesis on swarm robotics, and I'm planning on using RepastS for modelling purposes.
