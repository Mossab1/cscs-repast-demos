Current Task(s): _Nothing yet_

Finished Work: _Nothing yet_

=== Unimplemented Ideas ===
Here's a list of my ideas so far - will put in short descriptions later.
 * Boids
 * Three-bodies 
 * simple traffic 
 * simple weather 
 * ant foraging
 * penguin huddle
 * simple morphogenesis
 * cellular automaton 

===boids===
This is an old algorithm for agent-based modelling (it was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids published in 1986]), but it was definitely an influential one. Check out the video at the bottom of the page if you want to see what complex behavior a simple algorithm like boids can cause.

from my intro email:
 I'm an undergrad dual Compsci/Studio Art major entering my final year at  
 St. Mary's College of Maryland ...

 I've become pretty interested in swarm and complexity since I started 
 doing preliminary research on it for my senior undergraduate thesis on 
 swarm robotics. I'm not exactly sure what attracts me to complexity, but 
 I find the examples of organized swarms in nature very beautiful - my 
 favorite example is the collaborative process in which honeybees find a 
 new nest site. I'm interested to learn more about the optimizational and 
 societal applications of complex systems.

=== Other Stuff ===
this show is really cool:
