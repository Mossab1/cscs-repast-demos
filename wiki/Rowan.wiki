=== Unimplemented Ideas ===
Here's a list of my ideas so far - will put in short descriptions later.
 * Boids
 * Three-bodies 
 * simple traffic 
 * simple weather 
 * ant foraging
 * penguin huddle
 * simple morphogenesis
 * cellular automaton 

===boids===
This is an old algorithm for agent-based modelling (it was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids published in 1986]), but it was definitely an influential one. Check out the video at the bottom of the page if you want to see what complex behavior a simple algorithm like boids can cause.
